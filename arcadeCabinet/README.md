TODO: Pictures

Took to school as a teaching aid
Put in linux machine built themself and touchscreen=mouse joysticks=keyboard

Difficult to move
Every permutation of 2 player joystick 6 button

The was always a prototype; There was always the plan to build (what I termed) _The UltiCab_
Would it be used? Was it used? The answer was YES! YES! and YES!

Eventually the capacitors in the ELO CRT screen started to degrade and it could not hold a solid image. I attempted to repaire it but the compoennts were not user servicesable. I should have found a specalist to repair it. It was a great rare screen. I regret not servicing it.
