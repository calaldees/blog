Danni's spag bol
----------------
It’s an Italian based one. You chop or blitz up a carrot, onion and two celery sticks and soften for around 5minutes, then add your mince (around 500g- I usually use beef and pork mince). Then once that is brown add a glass (or small bottle) of red wine and reduce by around half.
Then add 2 chiken stock cubes, a tin of chopped tomatoes, a jar of passata (sieved tomatoes), a good squeeze of ketchup, tomato purée and salt and pepper. Then bring to the boil, turn down the heat and simmer for around 2 hours (mine usually takes an hour and a half)
Pro tip- If you mix the tomato purée with a little hot water before adding it it combines better
