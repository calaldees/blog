stir fry pork

Hey Al,

Making the stir-fried pork is pretty simple - first you chop up the pork in to chunks and marinade in soy sauce for a few hours (or overnight, whichever).  

Start cooking the rice, as you want it to be cooked and cooled by the time you add it to the rest of the stir fry.

Fry the pork with finely chopped garlic, ginger and chilli, then add some chopped veggies - stuff like spring onion, brocolli, peas, that sort of thing.  Season with a bit more soy sauce and salt/pepper to taste.

Add the cooled rice to the stir fry and cook up until nice and hot.  As a variation, you can add a couple of beaten eggs after adding the rice, stirring them in to make egg fried rice.

Apply mixture to face.
