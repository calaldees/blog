Joe's Caribbean Coconut Rice
---------------------------

There wasn't much of a recipe tbh. It was just:
* kidney beans, black eye beans (one can each). 
* One can coconut milk and rice (water or stock for the rest of the moisture)
* As for spices, it was salt, pepper, thyme, paprika and cayenne pepper.
    * I found I needed slightly less paprika than I thought worked well (or it starts to taste more Mexican)
* I started by frying onions then adding the spices to them.
* Before they burn add the drained beans, stir, after a few more mins, eyeball the rice, throw that in and liquids.
* Bring to a near boil ( not too hard or the coconut milk will split) then cover and cook as low as you can
* I found in a thick pan I could even just cover it and take it off the heat completely. That way the bottom doesn't stick, and the rice will cook in the residual heat

I tried
* 200ml bazmati rice
* 1 can creamed coconul
* 1 can kidney beans in chilli sauce
It was a little overpowering on the coconut liquid and I used no stock. I need to try more beans? and double the rice?
