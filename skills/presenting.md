Presenting
==========

* Wingman/CoPilot concept for presenting
* Outlawed words
  1. "umm" or "errr"
    * Anecdotes: Told the CEO 213 ums + 42 ums = 255 ums
    * Strategy: Practice a talk to someone and ask them to bang the table every time you do this.
  2. "Basically", "Simply", "So", "Ok", "Just" ...
    * or any other superfluous word
    * You are on a word budget. Ration your words!
    * "All you have to do", "Basically" or "Simply" should be banned. These trivialise a subject
    * Stop asking of things are "ok". If you need too, Deliberately request a response and pause sufficiently if needed to get this response.
    * Don't use vague words: "Things", "Stuff". Be specific
    * Try not to use "It" - fully qualify the subject
* Keep to time
  * It is better to have too little (focused) content than too much (waffle)
* Projection Tech
    * Raise font size (ctrl+=)
    * Learn how to use your laptop to output to projectors (quickly)
    * Have good Display connectivity in venues
      * Bring all the adaptors and cables you need (with sufficient length)
    * Maybe slack screen share as primary
* Physical Space
  * Look where the lights are
* Hands should be free
  * Technique: Use your hands and stage position to tell a story
    * Interpretive dance
  * Strategy: Practice with and/or Learn to use a mic (if needed)
* Technique: Learn to project your voice
  * You can't speak normally. This is a different setting!
  * Each - Word - Should - Be Clear (demo this speach - normal and then 'purposeful + projected')
* Behaviour and crowd control
  * Don't start until you have everyone's attention
    * Stick to your guns
    * Stop talking when they loose focus - they will look back at you to find out why you've paused and they will probably find you silently making eye contact back at them. This shows you know and are aware.
  * To bring people back with no-verbal queues
    * Use eye contact
    * Hand gestures to bring people forward and refocus
    * If people are distracted (using their phone, or computer, or talking) - Have the courage to pause - wait for eye contact - nod or smile or raise -eyebrow - move on
