Everyone is expected to be exceptional ... that's not possible

The MrBeast definition of A, B and C-team players is one I haven’t heard before:

> A-Players are obsessive, learn from mistakes, coachable, intelligent, don’t make excuses, believe in Youtube, see the value of this company, and are the best in the goddamn world at their job. 
> B-Players are new people that need to be trained into A-Players, 
> and C-Players are just average employees. ... They arn’t obsessive and learning. 
> C-Players are poisonous and should be transitioned to a different company IMMEDIATELY. (It’s okay we give everyone severance, they’ll be fine).

The key characteristic outlined here, if you read between the hustle-culture lines, is learning. Employees who constantly learn are valued. Employees who don’t are not.


Facebook has a "rise thought teh ranks or get fired"

Everyone do more ... for 'us' (the company/organization) ...

Everyone is not exceptional
Attitude of growth, sure, byt temper the expectations
