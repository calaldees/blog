Computing Vs Childcare - The great divide
=========================================

We can't address the gender imbalance in the tech sector without addressing the other side of the coin.
If we are serious about the gender balance in the tech sector we need to look at men in childcare and nursing.

There is however a reasonably difficult conundrum to solve.

To deploy a distributed server cluster takes an entire lifetime of training. Without 1000's of hours of training and experience it is simply not possible to accomplish the task. Most people that can do this specialise at school through university and with many years of practical experience at the age of 25ish a skilled practitioner may be abel to accomplish the task. An average untrained person can't even begin to attempt this. In the case the server deployment goes catastrophically wrong, there might be a small geographic server outage for a short period of time and maybe some short term dataloss. Mostly no lasting effect on anyone's life.

Childcare has almost no skill ceiling. The nuance of high level of sustained child psychology and perception [reword]. Building a child's foundational social skills takes time and effort. It is a skilled role. 
Conversely with the tech role, with childcare, an average untrained person can attempt the role. An individual can perform very poorly at the task, but the only failure case is "a young person is seriously injured or dead". This is rare and unlikely. The impact of sustained poor childcare can have a detrimental life long impact on someone's life.

So given what's at stake. Why do we continue to tolerate poor untrained childcare across society?
We have ethics that dictate that it is anyone's ongoing right to reproduce and raise their own offspring. There is no qualification of regulation. This is in contention with the need for skilled childcare.

Childcare could be regulated and high standards could be enforced. What the definition of those high standards could be debatable.
The other major factor is that _deployed servers_ for companies generate money. Children do not. Even though our entire future rests upon our young people and the values we instil upon them.

We can only address the gender imbalance in the tech sector if we also address the gender imbalance of other sectors.
The role of childcare should be highly valued by society, but largely it is not, due to the low bar to entry.

All of the above is also written under the assumption that a 50% 50% gender split is the correct goal.
