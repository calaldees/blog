Illusion of Choice
------------------

A common pattern of control/manipulation is to give people an illusion of choices where all the choices benefit your adgenda. e.g.

>> Would like peas or carrots with your steak?
> Who said I wanted steak at all!


This strategy seems universally accepted for guiding children

> Would you like to 'tidy your room' or 'eat your greens'?

Without the illusion of choice children become frustrated and don't build autonomy. Given actual choice they (currently) lack the mental capacity and experience to make informed choices.
