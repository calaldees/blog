Too Many Jumps Down the Tech Tree
=================================


A friend wanted to learn to code and was starting with React Native.
For those of you are not professional developers, React Native is a industry professional framework for creating mobile apps.

Coding is hard. Really hard. It takes years to even get the fundamentals.
I've met many many people that have tried and simply no appreciated the difficulty and the shear number of hours required.
There are many people peddling the idea that "Code is Easy" "Anyone can do it". This is damaging. People that then struggle with code think that they are somehow stupid for not doing the "easy" thing.
I've read forums posts of people that have spent years doing tutorials. They can copy the instructions but they are unable to create anything themselves from scratch. They were frustrated and did'nt no how to progress.

I've heard the phrase "I just want a video that can explain it simply at my level". The problem is that these videos do not exist. It's impossible to explain a complex topic without the technical vocabulary. I can say "Boat" and you know what I mean. Imagine if I had to qualify what a boat was every time I used the word. When people want a simple explanation for something that is 17 levels down the tech tree, it is simply not possible to explain the concept.
It's not really possible to explain blockchain technology without the concept of hashing and asymmetric key pairs.

Aspire to jump down the tech tree, but do you know what comes first? Scales. Doing hundreds of hours of boring ass scales to a metronome. Only then, will be able to shred like a daemon.

Stop trivialising complex disincline. Learn the terminology. Spend time on the foundations.
