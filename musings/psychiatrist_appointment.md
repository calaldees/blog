How to prep for a psychiatrist appointment!
===========================================
Go through the questions below before your appointment. Dont feel like you need
to memorize anything, just write it down in a journal and bring it with you!

### Answer these questions in detail:
* What are you currently experiencing and how is it affecting your life?
* What have you already tried to help manage this, and how far did that get you?
* What family history do you have with mental illness?

### Good questions to ask:
* What options do I have as far as medication?
* How long will it take for them to work?
* What potential side effects will I experience from this medication, and will they go away as my body adjusts to them?
* What drug-related interactions should I be aware of / try to avoid?
