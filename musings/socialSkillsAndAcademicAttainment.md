Social Skills and Academic Attainment
=====================================

Weak social skills impact on academic attainment.

A few weeks ago while lecturing on "Introductory Programming" for first year undergraduates, I noticed a stark difference in attainment between students.

After and hour as I circulated the room I identified students that were just sitting looking at their computer. The conversation went along the lines of "What are you working on", "Where are you stuck", the response was "everything". So I broke the task down, again, and relayed where the resources were, again. I then challenged the approach of the students. "Why didn't you take action? Why didn't you ask the people around you? why didn't you approach me sooner for help?" "You need to be proactive in your approach to your own learning"

Students with a average level of social efficacy were able to overcome the hurdles they faced.

The students with weak social skills were not able to access the content. This has been a compound effect throughout the entirety of their education and somehow they have survived the system and got onto a degree course. 

Being a teacher trainer for secondary education I know the demands of the curriculum and attainment. Schools are heavily scrutinised with their "Progress 8" scores. Examinable, quantifiable attainment. There is no criteria for "Can you ask for help?", "Can you collaborate on a problem?", "Can you take responsibility for your own leaning?".

Talking to an education colleague specialising in early years, they explained the depth of their framework for fostering these exact social principles/skills.
Even though the secondary national curriculum talks about social and cultural integration it is hard to compare practice between schools in these areas or monitor their practice.

From my observations, I can envisage a strong link between social aptitude and academic aptitude in the average case.

What is interesting is that the students that fall victim to this social gap are often the BAME students. It would be worth investigating the cause of this in more detail. Is it a downstream effect of a language barrier? Even in the cases of native english speakers there often still a social gap. What cultural factors could be contributing towards this? I don't have anywhere near sufficient sample size to know, but I am interested in exploring this further.
