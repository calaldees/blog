Predictions of the Future
=========================

I toughly enjoyed looking at some predictions of the future this new year.

* [Same Old](https://reallifemag.com/same-old/) - What is the point of imagining new technologies without new ways of living?
    * Jetsons is just the 60's nuclear family with the same roles
* [Image 87 of The New York herald (New York, N.Y.), May 7, 1922, (SECTION SEVEN) ](https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn83045774/1922-05-07/ed-1?sp=87&r=0.3,0.239,0.702,0.331,0)
    * Predictions about 2022 from 1922
    * Scary accurate
* Oh, 2022! [Looking 10 years](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2022/01/oh-2022.html)

(Being HTTP and centralised, I wonder how many of the resources above will be accessible, maybe IPSF and web3 will solve that, I digress)


2032
----

* Transport
    * Electric cars are more mainstream
        * It is common for homes to have had an electric charging port installed
    * International travel is a pain in the ass because of quarantine checks
    * Self driving fright is a reality in the US. This seriously disrupts employment and causes more anger and unrest.
    * Drones can deliver small items (in some palaces)
    * Rise in personal electronic transport prompts new regulation of pavements and pedestrianised areas.
    * Rail travel pricing is reformed to allow for more sporadic travel since the rise of home working
* Web3 will not have changed the world
    * For this to happen it has to do something better than the current systems. Google fund YouTube at a loss. Big companies have budget to make things Easier. It's going to be hard for the web3 tooling to push though the 'interface' most people use to interact with the world. 
    * Google and Apple own the portal/gateway to how most people interact with things.
* Education
    * AI support tools to individually assist students start to prove effective. Teacher are starting to be seen as the puppets of the already assembled programs
    * Tech certifications have more weight than most degrees. Mainstream education does not cater for the need for tech savy employees.
    * Funding of schools is fragmented and a mess. Schools fight for any kind of budget and are increasingly at the mercy of their funding sources
* Energy
    * Lots more smaller safer cheaper nuclear power plants starts to be built to deal with the load of electric vehicles. The public largely are not aware of this shift.
    * Battery technology improves to a cost ratio that make it viable for electric cars and grid storage
        * https://fullstackeconomics.com/untitled-2/
    * Hydrogen-fule used in some commercial way for larger vehicles
* Media
    * Mainstream media continues to be un-credible and sensationalised. There is little regulation.
* Brain computer interfaces
    * The public know of their existence
* Common for photos to be taken in 3D - rooms can be 3d scanned for archival with consumer equipment
* Politicians are starting to talk about regulation of tech but nobody can agree because politics and money are intertwined
* Online discourse grows more polarised and aggressive leading to big tech having to manage the poo flinging content. This puts big tech in an even bigger position of political power leading to more tech/politics teamups and under the table deals.
* Finance
    * Britain is hurt by Brexit and GBP continues to decline as a currency
        * Currently covid is blamed, but the whole planet has been hit by that
    * Cryptocurrency still remains largely underground. Smart contracts don't have power in the real world. The crypto landscape is too fragmented for a single dominant strain. Bitcoin is not fit for purpose.
    * There will be a financial crash ... well .. a dip ... it wont be the end of all things. It will bounce back reasonably swiftly because people love money.
* Health
    * The long tail of covid lasts most of the decade
        * People have had covid multiple times and it's starting to acrew longer term damage for many people
    * More and more children are diagnosed with ADHD and other behavioural disorders
        * People start to see genuine cognitive decline in young people blamed on short form content
    * Mental health issues increase across society
    * Fertility rates drop further in all developed countries and immigration continues
    * Masks are commonplace. Walking out into the street you will be able to identify people with masks on.
    * The new delivery mechanism for the covid19 vaccine ushered in a range of vaccines to cover a range of old/new diseases. HIV and Milaria are significantly reduced.
    * There will be a growing number of anti vaccine sentiments. This will start to cause longer term problems with many new infants not having sufficient protection against know/old diseases as vaccines are intermingled with newer less proven vaccines.
    * Diabetes grows and becomes one of the bigger problems in the west
    * Health insurance now requires people to wear a bio-logging device 24/7 to capture data. This is built into many consumer devices. (Mainly in america)
    * Individual gene therapy's + dramatically improve organ replacement
* China expands faster than the US and is even more of a global power.
    * Average people encounter more content that is in chinese in origin.
* There is a cult fascination with the world before the internet (pre 2000). Most of the youth consider anyone from that time like cavemen. Hohoho how uncivilised they must have been
* Technology becomes increasingly more complex and out of the sphere of understanding of most people. Big companies are able to smuggle additional functionality into devices.
* Homelessness will get worse - most places in the UK will have higher numbers of visible homeless people
* Privacy debate will continue - many people wanting to be outside of the mainstream technology are looked upon a criminals with things to hide.
    * Many people without mainsteam technology find it increasingly hard to interact with modern society.
* More and more jobs require more skill - more disparity with the lowest wage jobs and the higher paid jobs - this creates societal resentment. There are more calls for universal basic income as more and more people struggle to contribute economically
* Environment
    * Everyone still says the world is fucked, but nobody is doing anything sufficient about it. World leaders do not take enough action.
    * All calls for early geo-engineering are called lunatics
    * A sevier weather event hits the UK
* There will be more infrastructure around Mars and constructions of a manned Moon base, but this will take another 10 years to get to a significant size
* Everyone has a personal AI to help them. Be this for education, diet. We already have media recommendation + time + other commercial suggestions. It will start to become normal.
* VR technology becomes cheaper and more powerful and is more mainstream, but not taking over the world.
* Display technology continue to improve to an insane level
    * 8k screens? 120fps VR?
* Old movie/music celebrities are resurrected for movies/stage-shows.
* Some asshole will have rebooted "back to the future"
* Vaccine passports (or some way of verifying personal background is used in some aspects of society)
* Without a smartphone you cant perform many societal functions
* Bioinformatics is more prominent - you can get your genome sequenced and it will give us relevant and useful diagnostics
    * [Defining the Genetic, Genomic, Cellular, and Diagnostic Architectures of Psychiatric Disorders](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867419300480)
* Some types of crime is reduced by ongoing growing passive surveillance
    * GPS of phones at all times
    * High res security footage that with AI processing can identify people and interaction webs
    * Slowly these powers will slip in politically
    * More people prosecuted with data collected about them
* The revelations in videogames are the social aspects that map onto real life - Augmented reality-esq games rise in popularity
* Commercial areas in all cities decline in some way and are repurposed for residential as remote working because more commonplace.
    * People are moving out of cities.
* The first major international incident(/warfair?) with an aggressive attempt at disrupt/cripple a countries data or digital infrastructure.
* Launching satellites is dramatically reduced in cost
* Architecture becomes more expressive due to new materials and techniques
* Homes and other larger objects can be antonymously built
* Moon base is in progress
* The food industry is moving towards blockchain ledgers on all food. Blockchain starts to be used in other commercial sectors to prove ownership
* The food industry evolves to keep up with demand with GM most things and new concepts (floating farm? vertical farm? reconstituted something)
* Nanotubes and graphite become commercially viable to enable a new eara of construction.


2042
----

* Another global pandemic
* Unemployment due to automation causes significant unrest - There is to be a radical change to support the lower class's
* China and/or Russia use force (in some way - not necessarily physical) that scares the west, but the west is now financially weaker and still dependent on the east's manufacturing power
* AR is used commercially
* So much data is collected that it's almost impossible to interact with society without technological integration (e.g. we already buy bus tickets with our phones)
    * Digital integration is mainstream
* Man on Mars
* Regulation of social media in some form - it is deemed to be harmful to young people
* Scotland disentangles more from UK politics
* Major satellite issue (too many)
* Talks about geo-engineering become more serious as world leaders argue
* More Foods are GM modified to extend life and reduce cancers
* Space infrastructure is improving to a point where commerce is becoming more common
* Everyone has some aspect of their life planned/monitored/advised by personal AI
* Education is largely AI assisted
* You can have your life managed by a company (insurance, education, house, work).
* Social change alienates people born before pre internet
