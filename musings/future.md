Predictions of the Future
=========================

I toughly enjoyed looking at some predictions of the future this new year.

* [Same Old](https://reallifemag.com/same-old/) - What is the point of imagining new technologies without new ways of living?
    * Jetsons is just the 60's nuclear family with the same roles
* [Image 87 of The New York herald (New York, N.Y.), May 7, 1922, (SECTION SEVEN) ](https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn83045774/1922-05-07/ed-1?sp=87&r=0.3,0.239,0.702,0.331,0)
    * Predictions about 2022 from 1922
    * Scary accurate
* Oh, 2022! [Looking 10 years](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2022/01/oh-2022.html)

(Being HTTP and centralised, I wonder how many of the resources above will be accessible, maybe IPSF and web3 will solve that, I digress)

2032
----

* Transport
    * Electric cars are more mainstream
        * It is common for homes to have had an electric charging port installed
    * International travel is a pain in the ass because of quarantine checks
    * Self driving fright is a reality in the US. This seriously disrupts employment and causes more anger and unrest.
    * Drones can deliver small items (in some palaces)
* Web3 will not have changed the world
    * For this to happen it has to do something better than the current systems. Google fund YouTube at a loss. Big companies have budget to make things Easier. It's going to be hard for the web3 tooling to push though the 'interface'. Google and Apple own the portal to how most people interact with things.
* Education
    * AI support tools to individually assist students start to prove effective. Teacher are starting to be seen as the puppets of the already assembled programs
    * Tech certifications have more weight than most degrees. Mainstream education does not cater for the need for tech savy employees.
* Energy
    * Lots more smaller safer cheaper nuclear power plants starts to be built to deal with the load of electric vehicles. The public largely are not aware of this shift.
* Media
* Brain computer interfaces
    * The public know of their existence
* Common for photos to be taken in 3D
* Politicians are starting to talk about regulation of tech but nobody can agree
* Finance
    * Britain is hurt by Brexit and GBP continues to decline as a currency
        * Currently covid is blamed, but the whole planet has been hit by that
    * Cryptocurrency still remains largely underground. Smart contracts don't have power in the real world. The crypto landscape is too fragmented for a single dominant strain. Bitcoin is not fit for purpose.
    * There will be a financial crash ... well .. a dip ... it wont be the end of all things. It will bounce back reasonably swiftly.
* Health
    * The long tail of covid lasts most of the decade
        * People have had covid multiple times and it's starting to acrew longer term damage for many people
    * More and more children are diagnosed with ADHD and other behavioural disorders
    * Fertility rates drop further in all developed countries and immigration continues
    * Masks are commonplace. Walking out into the street you will be able to identify people with masks on.
    * The new delivery mechanism for the covid19 vaccine ushered in a range of vaccines to cover a range of old/new deseases. HIV and Milaria are significantly reduced.
    * There will be a growing number of anti vaccine people. This will start to cause longer term problems with many new infants not having sufficient protection.
* China expands faster than the US and is even more of a global power.
    * Average people encounter more content that is in chineese
* There is a cult fascination with the world before the internet (pre 2000). Most of the youth consider anyone from that time like cavemen. Hohoho how uncivilised they must have been
* Technology becomes increasingly more complex and out of the sphere of understanding of most people. Big companies are able to smuggle additional functionality into devices
* Homelessness will get worse - most places in the UK will have higher numbers of visible homeless people
* Privacy debate will continue - many people wanting to be outside of the mainstream technology are looked upon a criminals with things to hide.
* More and more jobs require more skill - more dipartity with the lowest wage jobs and the higher paid jobs - this creates societal resentment. There are more calls for universal basic income as more and more people struggle to contribute economically
* Environment
    * Everyone still says the world is fucked, but nobody is doing anything sufficient about it.
    * All calls for early geo-engineering are called luncatics
* There will be more infrastructure around Mars and constructions of a manned Moon base, but this will take another 10 years to get to a significant size
* Everyone has a personal AI to help them. Be this for education, diet. We already have media recommendation + time + other commercial suggestions
* VR technology becomes cheaper and more powerful and is more mainstream, but not taking over the world.
* Old movie/music celebrities are resurrected for movies/shows.
* Some asshole will have rebooted "back to the future"
* Vaccine passports (or some way of verifying personal background is used in some aspects of society)
* Bioinformatics is more prominent - you can get your genome sequenced and it will give us relevant and useful diagnostics
* Crime is reduced by ongoing growing passive surveillance
    * GPS of phones at all times
    * High res security footage that with AI processing can identify people and interaction webs
    * Slowly these powers will slip in politically
* There are no real revolutions in genres of video games


2042
----

* Another global pandemic
* Unemployment do to automation causes significant unrest - There has to be a radical change to support the lower class's
* China and/or Russia use force in some way that scares the west, but the west is now financially weaker and still dependent on the east's manufacturing power
* AR is used commercially
* So much data is collected that it's almost impossible to interact with society without technological integration (e.g. we already buy bus tickets with our phones)
    * Digital integration is mainstream
* Man on Mars
* Regulation of social media in some form
*
