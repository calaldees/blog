Community is "Unneeded"
=======================

I made a statement in a conversation with a friend over breakfast today.

> The nail in the coffin, the problem, is (pointing to the smartphone on the table) that device. It it facilitates the decay of communities because ...

They tried to justify the benefits of keeping in touch with family and friends. They unlocked their smart phone and gazed at it swiping while I was talking about the points below. They replied "I'm listening" while still swiping. I stopped talking. There was a justification about how an ex-colleague was struggling with her new job even though she earns more than them and that this was a pattern even back in their university days with not getting as much attention from a project supervisor even though it was demonstrable that she had got more supervision time than others.

None of the the above was related to the conversation I was trying to have.

Before smartphones:

If you were old and had trouble getting to the shops. Your neighbors would get you food each week and check in on you.

Children could walk to school together without adult 100% supervision. Children could play in the local park unsupervised because the village children/families knew each other.

You neighbours took packages for you when you were not at home.

You HAD to have some reasonable sense of contributing back to community and being (reasonably) well mannered. If you really acted like an asshole you were cut off from (let me be pragmatic with the wording) "services" that you needed from other people. From your "community".

You don't need your neighbors to check on you (you don't even know their names. tennant's change constantly anyway).
You don't need your neighbors to bring you food, you can just get shopping delivered.
You must attend you children at all time (putting demands on parents time, who are already working full time)
You have to make an additional trip to pickup your packages and sign for them ... or head to a new grey electronically controlled eyesore dropbox in the street (grey box's complete with multiple security cameras to prosecute those that might otherwise vandalise the obelisk or thief's stealing the high tech good it may contain). The joys and progress of modern technology allowing us full-time workers to continue to order our goods online and not have to speak to another human.

The great facilitator of this all ... the smartphone. We don't speak to people ask how they are. We send them a text, and we can do that while in a queue for coffee, while talking to another friend in the queue. Our productivity has been multipled! Look how social we all are!

We don't "need" our communities. So we don't need to invest time in building/integrating with a community. We don't need to invest in social skills to interact with our community. We can be the biggest self serving assholes in the world and still get by with very little consequence. We don't need communities.

"People are self centred, self serving, entitled and self profiteering". That is the mood that is often describe society in modern times.
We don't know our neighbors. We don't need communities.

People are entitled to health care,
People are entitled to education,
People are entitled to WiFi,
And then we seem surprised when people act in an entitled manner.

And when their wireless data breaks, they are agitated by the poor quality of the network infrastructure. Even vocalise it to all those nearby. Everyone that hears this also concludes that modern society is on the downturn, even 3rd world countries have better connectively than this.

We don't "need" communities any more. We are facilitated by the "services" that are accessible with smartphones. Our social contact is accessible with smartphones.

The friend I was talking too finishes the story about her old friend she just saw a message from and finished her explanation of why the text message had grabbed her attention. "I was listening, you were talking about smartphones, carry on"

So I withdrew from the breakfast conversation, I had work to do, emails were mounting up, and I needed to battle to avalanche of written communication amassing that was part of my contractual obligations. Even though the emails come from other humans, I do this email review alone in an office.

I think it's time to change career, work with my hands with groups of people. Maybe a tree surgeon? Maybe move house, live in a less populated area. Trouble is I can't. I've got a new mortgage and will need to keep working full time every day for the next 34 years. Maybe there will be a community waiting for me when I retire at 74. But then again, we don't 'need' communities do we?

I'll say to the young people "Before the internet". And they will roll their eye's "Whatever granddad".

People who have escaped North Korea, or done volunteering in deprived villages in Africa have said something interesting. Even though these people are leading shitty shitty lives, they struggle for food, family members die of infection or parasites. They support each other in a community and observers have remarked "they are happy, they are loved".

Time to get back to work.
