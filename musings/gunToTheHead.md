Gun to the Head
===============


Nonsense
--------

I used to laugh at a scene in the hollywood movie "Swordfish" where an 'ace hacker' was put at gunpoint to 'hack the pentagon' with a gun to his head while being distractedly serviced by a young lady and given 60 seconds before the trigger was pulled to blow his brains out. Needless to say the 'ace hacker' survived by successfully hacking the pentagon.

Utter utter nonsense ...

Or was it?
Hear me out on this ...


The Gun
-------

I recently set a university programming assignment. We spent 4 months for this module. From day 1 I give the spec and a full set of automated tests. The students never really engaged with any of the content. Drifting in each session and looking blankly at the screen. Not working though suggestions.
The week before the deadline, a number of students asked "How do I setup my dev environment again?", "How do I clone the repo".

If you're asking about the most basic foundation steps of starting the assignment less than a week before the deadline then you've failed. You can't build skills that quickly.

So begins the flurry of 3am emails about basic stuff the day before the deadline. The messages are coupled with the snide remarks and a tone that preempt possible comments to suggest that attempting the task this late is being frowned upon. (There is a healthy undertone of "If you don't help me now I will use this to proclaim that you haven't supported me as weapon")
A surge of requests for 2 week extensions (they have had 4 months to do this and apparently another week will change that).


The joke scenario is now no longer a joke
-----------------------------------------

Many of the class completed the task.

All nighters, stress, anxiety, adrenaline, emotional turmoil. What a beautiful self inflicted cocktail.

What does this tell me?
It tells me that guns are effective.
Not only does it tell me that guns are effective, it also tell me that guns are the only method I currently know of to prompt people to action.


Another Gun
-----------

I was speaking to someone recently, they said 
> We say to often that young people with ADHD cant follow instructions and sit down; If you had a shotgun and gave them the instructions they would comply. 
> It's not that that they cant follow instructions, it's that they don't want to follow the instructions.
> Many of them are just assholes and we are giving them an excuse to be assholes.
I don't know if that's true or not. But again it raises the use of the gun.
I'm sure many of us can relate to situations like this.


Personal Gun
------------

A few years ago I had issues building up at work, at home with my housemates and a demanding external project that I was contributing a lot to. 
I had asked on multiple occasions for support, I expressed my needs and proposed actions.
Nothing happened. Another plea. Months pass ...  Nobody gave a fuck.

To make meaningful change I had to threaten. 
This is not my natural default. It took a lot to reach this point. 
One week I snapped.
I gave full on ultimatums to all three problems.
All three of them were (largely) resolved overnight.
Months of ongoing stress and issues ... just fixed, by using a gun.

Not only does it tell me that guns are effective, it also tell me that guns are the only method I currently know of to prompt people to action.


What now?
---------

UNFINISHED:

> Tank: What do you need?
> Neo: Gun's; lots of Gun's

Nobody likes guns.
But people only respond to guns.
