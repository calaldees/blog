You don't have permission to take my focus
==========================================

I despise smartphone. The tech is space age amazing .. I hate them because of the way assholes have built the software.

My phone bleeps: _Bloo-bo-bing_
(I ponder ... I asked a friend about meeting for coffee this weekend, could be them .. let's have a look)
> You have 7 apps that can be uninstalled
HOW THE FUCK IS THAT RELEVANT!! WHY DID YOU INTERRUPT MY DAY!

Suggestion to Phone OS Designers: You can tell me about my app updates next time I visit add/remove/update programs ... you know from my usage statistics I do this around on a monthly basis. I'm not a user that has no knowledge of this ecosystem, my past use shows this.

I could spend my time curating the notifications each app provides. The problem is the default for all apps is "on". 
I need to spend considerable time receiving notifications and turning them off. 
They should be off by default and enabled if I want that level of engagement.

Stop taking my focus.
My time does not belong to you.
Your software and business addenda are not my concern.

I was preparing for running a sequence of interviews. Collating details about the candidates

"Did you know that you are now able to edit videos in windows picture viewer via Chipcamp"
I don't edit videos. This is not something I use my computer for. Why are you taking my focus! I'm preparing for interviews. Who ran this popup program? I didn't! and I'm the user. You are 'my' computer, I'm not 'your' user. I'm driving you! WHY DID YOU TAKE MY FOCUS FOR A PROGRAM I AM NOT INTERESTED IN OR WILL NEVER USE! xxxx OFF!
