Thought Experiment - Funding Education?
==================

What would happen if ...


To study, people need:
    Place to live (food, heat, cloaths)
    Some form of focus space (may not be home)
    Time (normally acquired when people have somewhere to live and food)

What if we just didn't fund any schools and just passed the cash directly to the learners? They could then choose to give their cash to professional teachers. Most of them a quaks anyway and the internet exists.
