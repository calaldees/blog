Saw a funny image of "I decentralised my phone" and it was set of separate items - camera, doctaphone, map etc. I wanted to compose my own list

Two eras - old physical and “devices that do things that smartphones can do e.g. ereader”

Book -> eReaders
Filofax -> Calendar
Pocket Map -> world? Uk? London?
Pager -> recv text
Mobile/Cordless (old)
Dictaphone
Mp3 player
Alarm clock
Bus/train timetables
