Education Technology - Boon? or Bust?
=====================================

The Past
--------

In the old days a lecture theatre of 200 people would be bustling. The lecturer began to talk without amplification and the room fell respectfully silent. This moment was only going to happen once. Students frantically scribbled notes and tried to digest the content. If anything was unclear they had this tiny time-window of an hour to ask questions.

Students were focused, attentive and grateful for the opportunity to be in the presence of such knowledge.


The Present
-----------

Attendance is poor at lectures, why attend when it's recorded anyway. As the lecturer talks, many students browse unrelated content on their phones. There is no need to ask questions because Google will reveal some higher quality content in seconds. Students are _customers_ now. The expectations of the presentation style have risen. "I paid Â£9,000 for this crap? time to raise a complaint".


The Conundrum
-------------

We now have better technology, higher quality content, that is immediately searchable. But are out students sharper and better equipped? It could be argued that so many more people now have access to education and that wider access means that we are going to see much more lackadaisical engagement. The sharp/engaged students still exist (and in the same numbers as before).

We can't go back in time. Progress if progress. Could we take some themes and techniques from these older ways and apply them thoughtfully to the modern world? Or is that like trying to apply a square peg to a round hole?
