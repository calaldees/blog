Dr Pepper Fire
==============


> There is no place for a fire on a Duke of Endinbur campsite

Kids summer camp - campfire



Dr Pepper on the fire

11 to 16 year olds

Were they evil? or idiots? or both?

Possible consiquences - perminant facial scaring, blindness

Without my actions would people have been injured?
Would I ever be thanked for that action?
We will never know.

Takeaways

1. There will be many actions that we take that we do not get recodnition for. We do them because they are the right things to do.
2. Rules are often created for a reason. Even if they seem heavy handed and unfathomably draconion.
3. Children need protecting from themselfs and each other. They are not nice, they are not smart.
4. These near miss's are often under (something? word?). Young people never understand the consiquences
    1. (bottle at head at night cycling)

Near miss's should be documented and analysed - company policy
