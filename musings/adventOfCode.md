Passionate developer
invited to advent of code
did not want to waste time doing gymastics
wanted to build stuff
maybe I have not honed/developed my computing problem solving skills - maybe this hurts me in interviews
Maybe I've got the right idea. write code for a reason, that dose something, that impacts the world/people in someway
