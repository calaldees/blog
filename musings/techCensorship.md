Whenever I mention topics like this, people tell me I'm far too doom-sayering. ...

This dude had his entire channel removed from youtube because he made a video of using a PI5 as a media server.

eBay had a stint of removing all sales of Raspberry Pis - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24976314 - heaven forbid a member of the public actually owned their own computer and installed an OS that was not sanctioned my Microsoft and Apple.

I've said multiple times that in the future, normal people will not have there own storage media at home.
Storage will only be sold to companies, and you'll be on a list for trying to do otherwise, probably terrorism or child porn or something.
People are too dumb to manage there own storage, it's too complicated. The best thing to do is ensure that large companies and services keep all your data. All your family photos. it's just more convenient. I don't need to remember if it's my phone, or my hard drive, or an sd card. I mean, I don't even know what those terms mean. Thank god Apple/Google/Netflix/Facebook are here to archive and manage my data for me.


A hacker news comment about the article I posted:

> I like the way Jeff signed off the article, pointing out that whilst the video has been pulled for (allegedly) promoting copyright infringement, Youtube, via Gemini, is (allegedly) slurping the content of Jeff's videos for the purposes of training their AI models.

> I checked, and they are still selling knives. Sure, you can use a knife to cut food or walk through the woods pretending to be a "survivalist" (judging from my search for "knives"), but it can also be used to murder people.
> But also checked "TVs", and they are absolutely still selling those. TVs are like the number one item used for infringement. I am VERY confused.
> And don't get me started about food. Without food, it's basically impossible to infringe, yet ebay allows all sorts of food listings.
> They also sell HDMI capture cards and HDMI splitters that can remove HDCP. As if those aren't encouraging infringement.
