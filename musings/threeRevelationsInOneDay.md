Three Revelations in One Day
============================

I'm probably catching up with the rest of humanity, but this was a heavy day.
At age 43.4 3 things hit me


The green initiative is fake
----------------------------

* Alliance for Responsible Citizenship [WATCH: An Honest & Sensible Conversation about Global Energy | Scott Tinker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTfwqvNuk44)

* Everyone has an energy footprint (forget Co2 footprint, energy is upstream)
* Every person in the developed world has a big energy footprint
    * Our poo/water is processed, our roads constructed, our cloud servers for our netflix, the manufactor of our iPhones and LiOn batteries, our food prepared and transported in refrigerated lorries, etc, etc, etc
* There are billions of poor people living in developing words 
    * in poor conditions, with shit water, heating their homes with wood and fumes
* There are no renewable forms of energy
    * Solar needs manufactor and disposing of, wind blades needs burrying, coal and oil are dirty,
* Green energy is only 10% of our needs
* If the bottom 50% - the poor people were to have energy footprints as big as the developed world, the energy use of the planet would double (if not tripple)
* Globally we _will_ be increasing our use of coal and oil
    * This is only going one direction


Coding is dead
--------------

* CS50 [Large Language Models and The End of Programming - CS50 Tech Talk with Dr. Matt Welsh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhCl-GeT4jw&) YouTube 1hour
* [A Coder Considers the Waning Days of the Craft](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/20/a-coder-considers-the-waning-days-of-the-craft) 15min read

* Trained my whole life to code, It gave me super powers that were not accessible to the rest of the population. I could create things that so many others could not.
* Like the hourseshoe maker when the motorcar came along, coding is dead
* Programmers have used high level languages for 50 years. Nothing much has changed. Programming is still hard.
* Average "developers" can just ChatGPT their way to a solution.
* The tools will get better. THe finite creating code by hand is gone.
* Machines don't need "high level languages", they don't need layes and layers of abstraction to name and understand concepts. They can just write in machine in machine code and bypass all our tooling.
* Everything I thought I could do has now dropped in value. I love the creativity and problem solving, but there is little place for that in the commercial world. 


Higher Education is emotionally hard
------------------------------------

Why? because "I" fail students. I am the judge.
In school, I prepare young people for the exam and the students pass or fail themselves to a known national vetted fair exam that the rest of the country sat at exactly the same time.
In HE; I make the judgment. The students hate me. They actively fight and challenge me. None of this happens in school. The exam makes it's judgement. Same rules for everybody. When a student fails, they fail themselves.
I finally know why I struggle to work in education anymore.
