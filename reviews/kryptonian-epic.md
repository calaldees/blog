The Kryptonian Epic
===================

"The Kryptonian Epic" Max Landis DC inspired universe.

Below is a set of a links to a screenwriter, who has had a turbulent 'canceled' career in recent years, but is still releasing exceptionally interesting content. 
He conveys an entire saga, retelling his own reinterpretation of superman. He does this by just talking to the camera and then ups the anti by getting some of his friends dressed in cosplay and filming re-enactments in a theatre. 
It's a really impressive and immersive way of storytelling that is somewhere between 'writing', 'theater performance' and 'a movie'.

Summary/Overview
-----------------

(This came from the first pinned comment to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9xb8XrfZ9E)


So seeing as we're nearing the end of this weird multimedia project of collective projected imagination about the nice man in the red and blue and all his strange pals, I, a humble witness to the madness, have knocked together a guide to the whole of the Kryptonian Epic, a sort of directory that maps each "book" of the epic to the videos which tell their stories. If you watched any of these and felt you were missing some context, or if you need a reminder, this is for you, for everyone's who's been connecting dots and tracing lines across the infinite. It's a been a ride, and we're near the end, all of us, waiting for the worlds to collide and be soaked clean in fire and blood.  

Organizing the videos that comprise the Kryptonian Epic presents a challenge, not just because of the length and breath of many of the subjects and their achronological order of release, but their tendency to cover narratives in such a way that they crisscross between the various “Books” of the larger epic. 


What follows is an effort to map the various main sequential narratives of the Kryptonian Epic to published YouTube videos made to tell their stories. It should be noted that these stories were told out of order and that some canon and relevant videos either take place between or parallel to these defined narratives, such as “The Deposition of Barry Allen” which is set between the stories of For All Mankind and Endangered Species (CORRECTION: See note below), or are stitched through the whole of the epic, including larger stories that have yet to be told, such as “MONSTER! The Story Of Rudy Jones, The Man Who Shocked The World Twice.” 

It should be noted that some details of the epic shift between tellings, such as the manner of the conclusion of the confrontation between Diana the Wonder Woman and the Society in For All Mankind.



Krypton: Zod’s Masterpiece – The first chronological story of the epic, and the last story of Krypton before it stopped being a planet and became a very dangerous idea, is covered in the videos “The Kryptonian Epic - What Happened On Krypton?” And “The Kryptonian Epic: LORE DEEP DIVE - Krypton and 🆉🅾🅳'🆂 🅼🅰🆂🆃🅴🆁🅿🅸🅴🅲🅴.” Despite serving as a prequel to the rest of the epic, Zod’s Masterpiece would release before the final Superman story of the epic, The Starlight Emperor. 



Aquaman: At The Depths of Madness – The origin story of Earth’s first post-human, Arthur Curry, The Aquaman, and the story of the amazing discoveries and consuming madness that would form and shape the blessed child have been covered in the video AQUAMAN: AT THE DEPTHS OF MADNESS and THE INSANE THIRD ACT OF SUPERMAN: DO-IT-YOURSELF! 

 

Superman: American Alien is a published DC comic available for purchase from most major retailers. Many of the stories in the epic begin around the same time of or run concurrently with American Alien. The video “MARTHA KENT RECEIVES A V̴̨̌I̸̙̓Š̴̼I̸̩̔T̷̹͐Ò̶͍R̷̡̓” takes place between issues 3 and 4 of American Alien.



Freeze: Test Run – A story of brilliant people with potentially disastrous ambitions and the impossible situation into which they all find themselves individually drawn, focused through the lens of disgraced Austrian physicist, visionary and verified “dude who married his cousin” Victor Fries, has been mostly covered in “The Kryptonian Epic Presents: The Color Blue”, “KIRK LANGSTROM VIBEZ” and “The Kryptonian Epic: The Incident At Ace Chemicals Audiobook”



Superman: Agent of Batman – This story is told in the pitch video of the same name.



Z! The Magical Girl/The Blue Beetle Saga – The finer details of the life and times of the worlds only magical person have as so far gone unrecounted, but the broad strokes of Zatanna’s story pre-Superman are outlined in “DEEP DIVE INTO LEX LUTHOR/BLUE BEETLE - SUPERMAN KILLS DEADSHOT.” This video also contains much of the story of Ted Kord, the superheroic cop-turned-urban shogun known as The Blue Beetle, before he and Z are folded back into the larger story of the epic. This video also contains material from the second act of Superman: Do-It-Yourself. A more detailed summary of the whole of The Blue Beetle Saga can be found in the article “ TED KORD: AN ILLUSTRATED BIOGRAPHY OF THE BLUE BEETLE” on Landis’ Medium page. 



The Queen Prince – The early parts of the story of two men destined to be involved in some of the strangest times their planet will ever know are recounted in “Max Landis Explains Oliver Queen And The Riddler - Two Shades Of Green.” Queen Prince also feeds into Superman: Agent of Batman, for Superman’s first meeting with Edward Nigma and for the first act of Superman: Do-It-Yourself, for Clark’s recruitment of Nigma and Oliver Queen. The action climax of The Queen Prince, the final confrontation between the newly minted Green Arrow and the assassin Slade Wilson, or “Deathstroke” can be found starting at the 24:55 time mark in the video “halloween kills confusion / random pitches (5cream) / Green Arrow Versus Deathstroke”



Superman: Do-It-Yourself – The first and second acts of DIY can be traced though several separate videos, primarily listed in the sections for “The Queen Prince” and “Z! The Magical Girl/The Blue Beetle Saga.” The third act of DIY is dramatized in AQUAMAN: AT THE DEPTHS OF MADNESS and THE INSANE THIRD ACT OF SUPERMAN: DO-IT-YOURSELF!



The Society: Toy-Man - This story is told in the pitch video of the same name.



Batman: Deathwish - This story is told in the pitch video of the same name.



Superman: For All Mankind – The largest story of the epic, FAM is told through a multitude of different character perspectives spanning years within the fiction. “SUPERMAN: FOR ALL MANKIND Pitch - Max Landis Explains His Flash and Wonder-Woman” , “The Horrifying Truth About Wonder Woman - Pitch By Max Landis” , “Max Landis Presents: The Death of Batman” and “The Fate of The Batman - #KRYPTONIANEPIC - "The Diner Scene" all weave together and through one another to comprise For All Mankind. 



Superman’s Pals:  Certain character-centric videos share an out-of-main-timeline structure, charting a single characters journey through various parts of the epic but not reaching past a certain point, such as “A Brief History Of Smallville and Superman's Best Friend Pete F'n Ross” and “15 Straight Minutes Of Jimmy Olsen Content” both of which serve as character explainers and dovetail into The Society: Endangered Species, the Pete Ross video ending at the beginning of ES and the Jimmy Olsen video ending around ES’s late midpoint.





The Society: Endangered Species – This story is told in the film of the same name. 



The following works of the epic have been referenced in various videos but have yet to be dramatized or otherwise been the subject of videos. 

•	Superman: The Starlight Emperor

•	…Whatever Happened To The Last Son Of Krypton?/The Man of Tomorrow?

•	Green Lantern: Outbound 



 For whatever reason, any edits I try to make to this comment won't go through, so if you don't see the other correction (that the writer made, so it's legit) I got the placement of Deposition wrong, it takes place parallel to For All Mankind, around the midpoint! For anyone trying to place it in watch order, I think it's best viewed directly after For All Mankind, but if you wanna be faithful, there's a decent breakpoint in The Death of Batman to view Deposition, right before "NO LUCK" begins, though imo that breaks Death's flow in a way I don't think is worth it.
