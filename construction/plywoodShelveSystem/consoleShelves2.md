Console/Media Shelves 2
=======================

* A modular enhancement to the original console shelves
* They can be build/stacked modulaly.
    * Up to 3 units = 65*3 = 195 (233 is the house height)
        * 195 for 15 shelves
        * Old version was 196 for 15 (variable heights)
* 48 by 48 for a shelf gives room for most media units (tape, vhs, laserdisc, dvd, etc)

### Final Unit dimensions
Width 48 + (2*2) = 52
Height 61 + (2*2) = 65
Depth 48 + (2 backstop) = 50 (without door)

Useable height = 61
61/5 = 12.2 per shelf = 12.2 - 1.8 = 10.4 per shelf?


### How to cut
2.44m * 1.22m * 18mm = Â£40 Hardwood Plyboard

* 48
    * 48 * 5 (shelves) = 240 (4 leftover)
* 50 (from 48+2)
    * 61*2 (sides) + 52*2 (top/bot) = 226 (18 leftover)
* 24 (leftover)
    * 61*2 (back*2) = 122 (122 leftover)
