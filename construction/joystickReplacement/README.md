Joystick Replacement
====================

Problem
-------

Amiga, ST, Spectrum, C64, Amstrad, Atari 2600
All have single button joysticks.
9pin standard

Many platform games used `up` as a jump mechanic
Turrican
Rainbow islands

Up as jump is an awful control pattern

Other games like 
Lotus 3 0 use up down for gears
Supercars 2 use up down for weapons

Up and Down need to discreet buttons separate from left and right

I was weaned on PC games without a joystick. The greatest weapon was z,x o,k? space

On a pad, switching between left and right has an overhead.
It is possible with discreet buttons to switch between left and right quicker

Sadly many Amiga games simply do not allow the configuration of keyboard keys and _require a joystick_

Solution
--------

Custom arcade button controller that replaces single button 9pin joystick

```
10deg will do
