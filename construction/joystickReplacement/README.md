Joystick Replacement
====================

Problem
-------

Amiga, ST, Spectrum, C64, Amstrad, Atari 2600
All have single button joysticks.
9pin standard

Many platform games used `up` as a jump mecahnic
Turrican
Rainbow islands

Up as jump is an aweful control pattern

Other games like 
Lotus 3 0 use up down for gears
Supercars 2 use up down for weapons

Up and Down need to descreat buttons separate from left and right

I was weaned on PC games without a joystick. The greatest weapon was z,x o,k? space

On a pad, switching between left and right has an overhead.
It is possible with descreat buttons to switch between left and right quicker

Solution
--------

Custom arcade button controler that replaces single button 9pin joystick
