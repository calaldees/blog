I'm sure if we knew the exact part number we could expand our search
for a suitable alternative.

The description of the links above point to these part numbers.
New DMD chip suitable as replacement for DLP chips with part numbers
1280-6038B, 1280-6039B, 1280-6138B, 1280-6139B, 1280-6238B,
1280-6239B, 1280-6338B, 1280-6339B, 1280-6438B, 1280-6439B (1280x800
pixels).

Cant see the exact part number in the technical manual for the Sanyo_PDG-DWL2500

I think the £120 UK one will do the job - I don't know what the
shipping+tax would be for the $59 US one.
