Not Dos .. but did not know where to put these

* [Setting up a Compact Flash card with Classic Workbench and WHDLoad for Amiga 600/1200](https://johan.driessen.se/posts/Setting-up-a-Compact-Flash-card-with-Classic-Workbench-and-WHDLoad-for-Amiga-600-1200/)
    * Great guide - uses PFS3 file system
* [Installing AmigaOS3.2](https://lyonsden.net/adventures-with-amigaos3-2/)
* YouTube [Setup Amiga Hard Drive using FS-UAE ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88jxTQo4uhs)
