(5 * (9.68 + 1.8)) + (2 * 1.8) = 57.6

Comparison height
 75 is a table
 51 to 54 is a tv stand or arm of sofa

If I built it TV stand height - then I put items on top of it.
If I want to extend it vertically I can with another set of shelves the same dimensions

2.44m * 1.22m * 18mm = Â£38 Natural Softwood Plyboard


Width 61 + (2*2) = 65
Height 61 + (2*2) = 65
Depth 42 + (1.8 door + 0.2 gap) + (0.3 backboard) = 42.3

61
((42*2) + (61+2+2)*2 ) + 30   = 244 = (2 sides) + top/bottom (cut to 42 manually) + vertical-back-brace
61
(40*6) = 240 = 6 shelves

Will need some thin battering for the shelf runners

Useable height = 61
61/6 = 10.16 per shelf = 10.16 - 1.8 = 8.36 per shelf? is that enough?
