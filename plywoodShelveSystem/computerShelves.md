Computer Shelves

    * RGB cables for computers/consoles

61(width)x40(depth)
9cm between shelves

(5 * (9.68 + 1.8)) + (2 * 1.8) = 57.6

Comparison height
 75 is a table
 51 to 54 is a tv stand or arm of sofa

If I built it TV stand height - then I put items on top of it.
If I want to extend it vertically I can with another set of shelves the same dimensions

2.44m * 1.22m * 18mm = Â£38 Natural Softwood Plyboard


Width (61 + 2*1.8) = 64.6
Height 61
Depth 40 + (1.8 door + 0.2 gap) + (0.3 backboard) = 42.3

61
(40*3) + (32*2) + 59.x = 244 (bottom + 2 sides) + (2 doors) + (59.x backboard - bit small, but yolo)
61
|40x6| = 240 = 5 shelves + top (4cm cut and leftover)

Will need some thin battering for the shelf runners
