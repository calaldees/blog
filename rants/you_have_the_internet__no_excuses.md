15 years old and trying to program in Pascal - no books - no network/people

Why are there people that are starting degree programs and have never written a line of code.
There are so many free quality resources available in seconds and all the software is free.
The problem is not access to information .. the problem is people are lazy, unmotivated and unable to think strategically and action things in their lives.
Or maybe the average person is just not capable of this.
Or why bother? Even if we don't self-actualise we have our basic needs met. Why play the game?

Lean to cod
(well not quite)
