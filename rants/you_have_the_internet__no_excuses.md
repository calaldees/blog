You have the internet - no excuses
==================================

In the 80's, the common idea was that people were poor because they lacked access to quality information. A huge amount of money was put into public libraries. It was deemed the problems was "access to information".

Fast forward to 2010+. The best quality information on the planet is freely available to everyone at almost zero cost (the infrastructure is already in place and everyone has access to ubiquitous technology to read/view content online)

Has "access to information" eradicated class inequality.
No.

I was 15 years old and trying to program in Pascal - no books - no network/people

Why are there people that are starting degree programs and have never written a line of code?
You would not start an art degree if you'rd never picked up a paintbrush.
You would not start a music degree if you've never picked up an instrument.
Why is this different for Computing?

There are so many free quality resources available in seconds and all the software is free.
The problem is not access to information .. 
the problem is people are lazy, unmotivated and unable to think strategically and action things in their lives.
Or maybe the average person is just not capable of this.
Or why bother? Even if we don't self-actualise we have our basic needs met. Why play the game of trying to self improve?

Lean to cod
(well not quite)
