Train Gates Dont work
=====================

* 3 people every day manning the gates at Canterbury West. 3 of them!

* Gate attendents do nothing
    * Wave last weeks ticket (they don't even look)
    * Slipstream (take no action)
    * physically push through (take no action - hoody up)
* Canterbury
    * Climb over gate

* Waste of money and infrastructure to maintain barriers, power them, mechanically service them, internet connections for them, operators that do very little don't need to be employed

* Employ spot check groups on trains
    * put the saved money into infrastruture and lowering the cost for everyone
    * Have fines that are defined by affordability index and not a flat rate. A £100 might be a lot now, but 12 years later when the rules have not been updated, it will be significantly reduced.
    * Have fines that are meaningful £1000
