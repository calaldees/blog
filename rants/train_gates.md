Train Gates Dont work
=====================

* 3 people every day manning the gates at Canterbury West. 3 of them!

* Gate attendents do nothing
    * Wave last weeks ticket (they don't even look)
        * Or mobile qr code
        * Or just say how you changed train and some other bollocks
    * Slipstream (take no action)
    * physically push through (take no action - hoody up)
* Canterbury
    * Climb over gate
* Check ticket on train
    * My season ticket card is cracked ... Then how did you get though the barriers? daily? you've been doing this for months? good ruse man

* Waste of money and infrastructure to maintain barriers, power them, mechanically service them, internet connections for them, operators that do very little don't need to be employed

* Employ spot check groups on trains
    * put the saved money into infrastruture and lowering the cost for everyone
    * Have fines that are defined by affordability index and not a flat rate. A £100 might be a lot now, but 12 years later when the rules have not been updated, it will be significantly reduced.
    * Have fines that are meaningful £1000

Our train barrier staff have outdone themselves today ... standing proud ... 3 of them ... their to man the barrier ... 
So I said, "Hey guys, you know, I nearly came in through your side gate, it's wide open"
The side gate was wide open, yet they had the barriers closed and 3 of them were sitting there slowing peoples day down.

Another majestic story. Bewildered woman with a ticket and wheely trolies could not get through the barrier, the started a conversation with her. More people with bikes turned up. I'm still not vocalising anything, I want to see what the specimins do and how long it takes them. They skill kept talking ... when the 3rd cyclist turned up and blocked the main door, one of the 3 gate guards asked the bewildered lady to step to the side. Yes there was a perfecly reasonably place to have the conversation, but none of them twigged.
