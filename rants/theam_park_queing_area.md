Legoland October 2024

* Flight of the Sky lion
  * Like a cattle farm
  * In a tent - It was an outdoor temporary space with vynal screens for walls, it was not sealed and daylight/wind coming though.
  * Dark - no light other than natural light from the seams of the tent.
  * Just a lame large tv showing trivia about some of the monsters "What species is XXX"
  * I'm not exageraing, it smelt of piss. Some poor child was in the queue too long and probably pissed on the floor. No attempt had been made to hose this down. It must of been there for days.
  * Nothing to do. Nothing to see.
  * It took 60 minuets
  * The ride was an IMAX screen with 3d monsters. The seats rotated and your legs danged to make it feel like you were flying. Fans blew at you to resemble speed.
  * Nothing about this was LEGO .. it was just 3d monsters.
  * Poor Theming

It felt like lazy modern thinking. Just use tech. Nobody cares about the overall experience.
It was the lazily produced with little thought.

Compare this queing area with the hex ride in alton towers.

Your customers will be spending more time queuing than experiencing the ride. Allocate your budget accordingly and care about the queuing experience.
