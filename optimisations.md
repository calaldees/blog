Optimisations and Attitudes
===========================

Here are a list of optimizations I have made in my life.
They have helped me to focus on the things that matter to me and simplify daily routines.
They are not a gospel for everybody, but a few of the ideas may be relevant to you.

* Transport
    * Raise heart rate once per day (by virtue of existing)
        * As part of my commute, twice daily I raise my heart-rate. I don't have dedicate multiple hours for the gym. I get 45min of exercise a day
    * _Use_ commute time (or aggressively minimize commute time as much as possible)
        * I have 2 hours on a train each day. I have a laptop. I get 10 hours a week to apply to my personal projects. This solace time can never be taken away from me.
        * The rest of my commute is cycling (see raise heart-rate above). This is not wasted time.
            * The constant risk of injury on the bike is countered by the long term health gains and quality of life later
    * Have a usable transport solution
        * Most of the people around me struggle to transport themselves and equipment
            * This limits their ability to
                * Freely attend social events
                * Waste time in transport (walking)
                * Struggle to move heavy objects
        * I have a folding bike. The handlebars are a T shape. I can hang a normal rucksack on the front handlebars.
            * My back is clear (for hi-vis vests) (extra cooling, no sweaty back)
            * I don't have to fiddle with clipping things down with bungees or crap
            * I can carry huge weights (weight is over the front wheel and stable)
                * The bike can double as a push trolley when critically loaded. I have regularly transported weekly shopping for 4 people consistently
        * Folding bike + train combo means I can use train time to be productive
* Home/Space/Domestic
    * Robot vacuum cleaner
        * It cleans regularly when I'm out. Consistently usable environment
    * Chairs are for humans to sit on
        * They are not storage space. The moment a chair is obstructed by items it fails to perform the task that it was constructed for
    * Wash up immediately
        * Whether you wash up now or 2 days time the time taken is the same
            * (maybe not because food drys and hardens)
        * A sink that is full of shit, is not usable as a sink for other things
        * Every item that is dirty is unusable until it is cleaned
        * Get a dishwasher (it cleans better (bacteria), with less water)
    * Tidy consistently/constantly
        * Every item should have a place where it goes. If you ever find the object not in it's correct place and it is not actively in use, return it to it's correct location.
        * By virtue of moving around your house you will clean/tidy as you go
        * Water droplets left in the shower will turn into crap, wipe them every day
            * Plastic body scrubbers do not retain water and smell like sponges or flannels
        * You will have multiple people using shared facilities. Keep all bottles/items out of the bathroom, (this inhibits efficient cleaning as they all have to moved to wipe any surface).
    * Kitchen sponges are bacterial colonies
        * Put them in microwave for 60seconds often
    * Bleach shoes
        * The moment they smell, cleanse them (50deg bleach - higher will melt the glue)
    * A beds take a known area of a room
        * Bunk-beds (space efficient)
        * Desk under bed
    * If you haven't used an item in a year, you probably don't need it. (Sell, pass-on-for-free or dispose)
* Social
    * No personal use of social media (facebook)
        * These detract from genuine human interactions, trivialize other people
        * Social media content is often of poor quality, vapid, low end bellendry. These are distractions
        * (social media use a professional tool this is useful for networking/outreach in moderation)
    * Your social circle should push/correct/inspire/grow
        * Cultivate your friends - support each other in growing
        * Identify toxicity, don't be afraid to challenge
            * Your _inaction_ has consequences
            * Loose the bellends
            * Challenge mobile use in social situations
                * If I am talking to someone and they browse their phone, I stop talking
        * You should actively push/correct/inspire and help other to grow
            * Assist them with lessons, training, health. If you don't have the skills, point them at others that do
    * Actively contact/visit people cycle
        * List the people that you want to keep social ties with
            * Your list will be manageable
                * You don't actually have 137 friends that you can actually keep in touch with (facebook)
            * Actively visit them
                * Anyone who lives in a commutable distance from where I work, I organize visiting with a sleeping bag and roll mat on work weeknights
            * Once you have visited everyone on the list, traverse the list again
    * You cannot grow in isolation
        * You must continually foster a comity/network
    * Custom print/make gifts/experiences for friends
        * Don't wait for birthdays/christmases. If you see something they would like, do it
    * You can't effectively care for others if you cant care for yourself
* Personal Equipment
    * Daily Equipment
        * Pockets (Never leave the house without these in place)

                * mini sewing kit
                * super-glue
                    * Used for minor cuts/injury
                * light headphones

        * Duvet
            * Light tog duvets can be machine washing (bigger ones cannot)

    * > In my examples the individuals were all _doing_ from a young age, as opposed to merely _schooling_. And while they may not have wanted to work, the work was nonetheless something that both they and society felt was useful: something purposeful and appreciated. In a sense they had useful childhoods.
    * > Do children today have useful childhoods?
    * > We should be thinking much harder about making sure children can make meaningful contributions to the world.
    * > Seizing opportunity requires opportunity to exist at all. And I suspect the downplaying of agency in childhood not only creates fewer opportunities for great people, it must also create more marginal people.

Here, we look for the historical traces of cognitive distortions, thinking patterns that are strongly associated with internalizing disorders such as depression and anxiety, in millions of books published over the course of the last two centuries in English, Spanish, and German. We find a pronounced “hockey stick” pattern: Over the past two decades the textual analogs of cognitive distortions surged well above historical levels, including those of World War I and II, after declining or stabilizing for most of the 20th century. Our results point to the possibility that recent socioeconomic changes, new technology, and social media are associated with a surge of cognitive distortions.
