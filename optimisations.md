Optimisations and Attitudes
===========================

Here are a list of optimizations I have made in my life.
They have helped me to focus on the things that matter to me and simplify daily routines.
They are not a gospel for everybody, but a few of the ideas may be relevant to you.

* Transport
    * Raise heart rate once per day (by virtue of existing)
        * As part of my commute, twice daily I raise my heart-rate. I don't have dedicate multiple hours for the gym. I get 45min of exercise a day
    * _Use_ commute time (or aggressively minimize commute time as much as possible)
        * I have 2 hours on a train each day. I have a laptop. I get 10 hours a week to apply to my personal projects. This solace time can never be taken away from me.
        * The rest of my commute is cycling (see raise heart-rate above). This is not wasted time.
            * The constant risk of injury on the bike is countered by the long term health gains and quality of life later
    * Have a usable transport solution
        * Most of the people around me struggle to transport themselves and equipment
            * This limits their ability to
                * Freely attend social events
                * Waste time in transport (walking)
                * Struggle to move heavy objects
        * I have a folding bike. The handlebars are a T shape. I can hang a normal rucksack on the front handlebars.
            * My back is clear (for hi-vis vests) (extra cooling, no sweaty back)
            * I don't have to fiddle with clipping things down with bungees or crap
            * I can carry huge weights (weight is over the front wheel and stable)
                * The bike can double as a push trolley when critically loaded. I have regularly transported weekly shopping for 4 people consistently
        * Folding bike + train combo means I can use train time to be productive
* Home/Space/Domestic
    * Robot vacuum cleaner
        * It cleans regularly when I'm out. Consistently usable environment
    * Chairs are for humans to sit on
        * They are not storage space. The moment a chair is obstructed by items it fails to perform the task that it was constructed for
    * Wash up immediately
        * Whether you wash up now or 2 days time the time taken is the same
            * (maybe not because food drys and hardens)
        * A sink that is full of shit, is not usable as a sink for other things
        * Every item that is dirty is unusable until it is cleaned
        * Get a dishwasher (it cleans better (bacteria), with less water)
    * Tidy consistently/constantly
        * Every item should have a place where it goes. If you ever find the object not in it's correct place and it is not actively in use, return it to it's correct location.
        * By virtue of moving around your house you will clean/tidy as you go
        * Water droplets left in the shower will turn into crap, wipe them every day
            * Plastic body scrubbers do not retain water and smell like sponges or flannels
        * You will have multiple people using shared facilities. Keep all bottles/items out of the bathroom, (this inhibits efficient cleaning as they all have to moved to wipe any surface).
    * Kitchen sponges are bacterial colonies
        * Put them in microwave for 60seconds often
    * Bleach shoes
        * The moment they smell, cleanse them (50deg bleach - higher will melt the glue)
    * A beds take a known area of a room
        * Bunk-beds (space efficient)
        * Desk under bed
    * If you haven't used an item in a year, you probably don't need it. (Sell, pass-on-for-free or dispose)
* Social
    * No personal use of social media (facebook)
        * These detract from genuine human interactions, trivialize other people
        * Social media content is often of poor quality, vapid, low end bellendry. These are distractions
        * (social media use a professional tool this is useful for networking/outreach in moderation)
    * Your social circle should push/correct/inspire/grow
        * Cultivate your friends - support each other in growing
        * Identify toxicity, don't be afraid to challenge
            * Your _inaction_ has consequences
            * Loose the bellends
            * Challenge mobile use in social situations
                * If I am talking to someone and they browse their phone, I stop talking
        * You should actively push/correct/inspire and help other to grow
            * Assist them with lessons, training, health. If you don't have the skills, point them at others that do
    * Actively contact/visit people cycle
        * List the people that you want to keep social ties with
            * Your list will be manageable
                * You don't actually have 137 friends that you can actually keep in touch with (facebook)
            * Actively visit them
                * Anyone who lives in a commutable distance from where I work, I organize visiting with a sleeping bag and roll mat on work weeknights
            * Once you have visited everyone on the list, traverse the list again
    * You cannot grow in isolation
        * You must continually foster a comity/network
    * Custom print/make gifts/experiences for friends
        * Don't wait for birthdays/christmases. If you see something they would like, do it
* Personal Equipment
    * Daily Equipment
        * Pockets (Never leave the house without these in place)
            * Front Right: Keys (tiny knife/scissors), tissue
            * Rear Right: Wallet (slim plastic credit card holder)

            * Waterproof, clear sealable bag - survival kit

                * Screwdriver/alum-key
                * Cable-ties
                * fold-able knife/fork/spoon
                * usb-stick,sd,xd
                * mini sewing kit
                * super-glue
                    * Used for minor cuts/injury
                * light headphones
                * earplugs
                * hand cream (non greasy)

            * You need to be free to communicate and be productive anywhere
        * No smart phone

            * I control my mental space
            * I can't consume and digest effectively meaningful media on a phone
            * I can't respond effectively or deeply with the restrictive input device
    * Items should be modular whenever possible
        * Coats
            * Light waterproof wind proof coat (outer shell) + Jumper (for insulation)
            * Both can be used in summer and winter effectively. You don't need a whole cupboard of different coats.
        * Duvet
            * Light tog duvets can be machine washing (bigger ones cannot)
            * Add more layers when needed. You can wash them independently + scale to required temperature for the time of year
    * Wear the same cloths everyday

            * Easy to replace
            * Half smart, half casual
* Food
    * Powdered food
        * You don't need to eat/drink it every day, but have it to hand
