Developers Timetable
====================

Developers should have their timetable free to _develop_.
Stop distracting them with any unnecessary work that is not directly related to _delivering a quality product_

Example TimeSplit
-----------------

Sprint = 10 working days = 7 hours per day

30% Code-review / pair-programing (3 days == 21 hours)
20% (maximum) Meetings/huddles (delivery focused) (2 days == 14 hours (or less))
40% Solo Code (4 days == 28 hours)
10% HackTime (1 day == 7 hours)

Example Sprint Timetable
------------------------

* 1 Thursday - morning - Sprint planning
* 1 Friday
* 2 Monday
* 2 Tuesday - afternoon - Team Sizing
* 2 Wednesday - afternoon - [Bug triage (with a team representative) + business]
* 2 Thursday - afternoon - [Additional Sizing + other if needed]
* 2 Friday
* 1 Monday
* 1 Tuesday afternoon - Retrospective
* 1 Wednesday - Hacktime
    * Do not cancel hack time, move/delay the day if needed, work should be predictable and plan-able

Note that Mondays and Fridays are largely left clear. This is because many annual leave request statistically fall around extending weekends. Monday and Friday are often observably low energy days (from fatigue).

The cost of meetings
--------------------

Meeting cost per hour - calculate the cost of the combined salaries of everyone in the meeting - Put the cost on a slide at the beginning of the meeting - RoughYearlySalary/(((356/7)*5)-28-8)/7.5 = Cost per hour per person (to nearest pound) + Office space per person per hour = Total up cost of all meetings?

Time for releases
-----------------

There should not need to be regular planned time for a 'release day'. Features should be released as they are completed as part of normal workflow. (There are exceptions, updating mobile apps too often annoys users, so releasing once a sprint is acceptable)
