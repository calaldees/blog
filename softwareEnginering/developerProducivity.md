Developer Productivity
======================

As a business you want to be as efficient as possible with your resources
As a developer you want solve complex problems in elegant ways

I have worked in organizations where I felt productive
I have worked in organizations where I have struggled to produce quality/timely solutions

Here are some observations as to why this might be the case

I start my task.
I'm not quite sure of what is required. There are details missing from the ticket. I have to clarify the task.
Once I have obtained clarity I begin implementation
With further discussion it appears that was not the expected direction

If confidence in the task is undermined, progress will be slower and more cautious


I complete my task and try to run my solution on a system that isn't my local machine.
It fails.
There are now two potential causes
It's outside of my control, some external system/resource needs actioning that is outside of my control.
I have to stop my task and attempt to continue another productive task (context switch overhead)

If infrastructure is owned by the team - I have the ability to diagnose and correct the issue myself
If the problem is the state of another system that it outside of the teams control, I am blocked

If my immediate tasks are blocked I can circulate with the team, getting involved in interim code reviews or pair programming.
If the team's normal flow is individually focused on tasks, this collaboration is not received well.

The more I context switch between tasks, the slower the progress of all my tasks
One task followed through linearly to completion means the business get's that value sooner
