Miscellaneous Bits
==================

Desks
-----

Not all desks in an office are equal. Some are near windows (daylight), some are too close to the kitchen or walkways, some screens face away from the mainstream gaze.
Each sprint, get into the habit of moving to another desk. (keep teams together)
This builds further social bonds with new people and shares poor/good desk positions.
Side effect. Encourages cleaner desks.

Business/Team Structure
-----------------------

Don't create a structure for the business and fit your people into it.
Consider an _organizational structure_ for 'Who you have' to enable them to be as effective as possible.
People joining/leaving a team are the opportunity to restructure effectively.
