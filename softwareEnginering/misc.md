Miscellaneous Bits
==================

Desks
-----

Not all desks in an office are equal. Some are near windows (daylight), some are too close to the kitchen or walkways, some screens face away from the mainstream gaze.
Each sprint, get into the habit of moving to another desk. (keep teams together)
This builds further social bonds with new people and shares poor/good desk positions.
Side effect. Encourages cleaner desks.

Business/Team Structure
-----------------------

Don't create a structure for the business and fit your people into it.
Consider an _organizational structure_ for 'Who you have' to enable them to be as effective as possible.
People joining/leaving a team are the opportunity to restructure effectively.

Tickets "Assigned to"
---------------------

Rename to "active by".
Assigning tickets to individuals implys that it is not a team delivery


Other notes
-----------

Burndown charts are useless. Just throw them away.


Cherrys? - How do we make simple tweaks without the heavyweight ticket process (if at all)


Remote work -


Feature
  products (internal?)
Business features
  Defenition of done
  Cant with our current workflow
Disaplin
 Cowboy developers stearing business direction - messing with sprint - individuals favor themselfs, not team deliverables (code review)
 Support specalist - Float + support - it's the teams deliverables
 Triage - how does the business decide - who decides
 Sizing + prediction
 Code reviews are not a (gateway to overcome, or slow us down, or a bother, flinging your 2000 line masterpeice at an inexperienced developer does not make you better. )
    Code reviews - face to face  - upskill weaker devs with rational and care - allow higher bandwidth disscussion) - purpose is to share knowlege

> I believe the change needs to be actively driven by leadership
> Vital shifts include a shift from directive to supportive leadership. A shift from centralised to decentralised authority. A shift from focusing on the work, to focusing on direction and creating the environment for success. Not just with words, but with structural and policy changes to enable the changes to happen. These changes cannot be driven from the bottom up.

> companies with engaged employees significantly outperform their competition

Terminology
