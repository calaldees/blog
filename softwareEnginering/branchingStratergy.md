Branching Stratergy
===================

I've observed very common practice that seems almost universal, but is reasonably flawed

`develop` should not become `master`

Cooking-pot space

We can't 'try out' a deployment until we viciously protect it with code reviews.
Just merge it and try it on an environment

Or just have better parity with local/dev/prod envionrments
kubanteies

When environments are limited - you must have safe cooking-pot space
