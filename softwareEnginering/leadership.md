Leadership

I wrote the stub of this a few years ago (2019) and stumbled upon it in (2022). I was struck by how clear the points were and spent some time formatting it so it read properly in markdown

Hey! Leadership! Listen up! Here is some Dev wisdom!


## 1.) Developer Tooling and Development Experience

* As a developer I self-identify by my ability to deliver value. This drives my personal self-esteem.
* If I am constantly battling with poor tools, unreliable infrastructure that needs to be constantly diagnosed/fixed, long build times, heavy approval processes that are token gestures that don't help create better software.
* If it takes me a long time to deliver value - then I feel that I'm not making progress. Not making progress for the business. Not making progress for myself.

* We have never prioritised 'time' to improve our development environment/tooling or the developer experience.
* Leadership is not experienced in software development so they are unable to recognise the time we are losing from poor tooling. Leadership do not track it because they do not know how to track it. Most of the developers (in this organisation) don't know how to track it.
* Poor tooling means we spend hundreds of untacked hours fighting with our development tools to build software.

* e.g. The entire stand-up this-morning was “We are battling shifting dependencies” it’s 3 senior devs time.
    * Why do we need 11GB of stuff all installed in one container and then have to reproduce 100's of shifting dependencies on remote machines that we don't manage… we need to slice this down. We are trying to keep 40+ balls in the air. We need to urgently come up with a strategy to slice this process into 40 tiny little containers that can be released independently and have a few dependencies as possible.

* "We have to deliver X!" So we keep working with this unworkable process.
* In summary
    * I can't see this trend changing.
    * It's not fun.
    * I'm not growing in skill.
    * The business is not growing.
    * If I remain here, I will just have to deal with the same workflow for years.


## 2.) Let the developers (the 'makers') focus on 'make'ing something

* Look at this developer calendar
    * http://agilebatman.com/2020/06/2-week-sprint-calendar/
    * Spoiler alert - there is nothing in the calendar other than standups, sizing, one retrospective and one planning session
* As developers you size tickets. Have retrospectives. Plan a sprint. The rest; Actually making what the business wants.

* The reason why developers can't focus on their tasks is because: there are no product owners, there is nobody assigned to BAU. Developers kind of have to do everything, so we need to be in loads of meetings and constantly task switch and constantly prioritise our time.
* If leadership could structure the teams so that 'developers develop' then we would be must more effective.
* A 'head of software' (at my previous company) said “Nobody talks to my devs”. It sounds like a harsh and controlling statement …. He was right .. he was awesome .. He shielded the business craziness from us. Developers could just focus on solving problems. Nobody sidestepped him. Nobody poached his developers focus.

* BAU
    * BAU tasks were separate from feature development
    * BAU was understood by the business.
    * BAU was monitored and controlled.
    * On a rota, you were either ‘making’ or ‘supporting’, never both.


## 3.) Care about your developers and product holistically
(And not just buying some fruit to put in the kitchen on Monday morning).

* Leadership wants features ... full stop ...
* I see little evidence of leaders having a caring watchful eye over their teams emotional state.
* The pain and heartache developers feel over wrestling with poor tools, to struggle to deliver something of value, only to be told "We want more, you should be faster".
* Leadership have the wrong mind set. A real leader would follow this process ....they would ask:
    * "Why did the feature take so long to finish"?
* Was it 
    * a developers lack of knowledge about a particular area of the system? 
    * Siloing, 
        * were we reliant on one person who was away 
        * or one person who already overloaded? 
    * One piece of software that has grown to do too much and needs to be split up because the build tooling takes 12 mins for each test cycle?
* What is the best course of action to raise productivity? 
    * Rather than developers feeling isolated can we start pair programming on small tickets? 
    * Can we change our use of language to reduce the friction within a team working remotely https://conventionalcomments.org/ 
* Leaders need to leverage their emotional intelligence.

* I see little evidence of leadership actively seeking to diagnose.

* Care about what the developers want to achieve, help them grow, let them contribute in their own way.
* If your developer is grumpy and disengaged, why are they grumpy? Why are they disengaged? Move them to other projects. Let them tackle the things that niggle them. Help grease the wheels and facilitate healthier team collaboration/communication. 
* If you’re a leader THEN LEAD!! Create the interactions you want. Observe. Diagnose. Take responsibility for your team.

* Leadership don't seem concerned that they have a poor track record of retaining staff.
* Loosing staff costs your company LOTS! It takes about 2 years for a developer to bed-in and truly understand a system to a point of being able to add real value
    * More here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t05tJTFQUK0
* I've heard comments like:
    * “He’s never really delivered for me” (so developers provide you - as an individual - This interesting, because that member of staff was a superhero who formed a communications bridge across 3 teams and ensuing everyone was unblocked as quickly as possible .... but apparently 'he did not deliver for you'.)
    * “I’ve not really seen his work” (you never looked or cared about the developers work, in fact you don’t understand it. And the developer works as part of a team, so why is their individual output now a criteria?)
* Detached leadership does not inspire confidence.


## 4.) Be really clear to developers about what is 'good', what is their 'goal'
* Everybody is just really busy. Furiously stressfully busy.
* Leadership muttered something about "We have OKR's now"
* Nobody understood them. They have been largely forgotten.
* Why? ...
* Because you have to have a measure.
* No leader actually setup the workflow to measure anything. No work was prioritised to collect these metrics. Nobody knows what the goal is. Were we 68% effective or 72% effective?
* No developer knows what we are aiming for. We just do tickets that we either pick them out of the air or get given to devs without much thought. The work is vague and difficult to quantify.
* Because of this, developers feel disconnected.
* Have we made progress?
* Don't know ... nobody knows.


## 5.) Let developers be creative and solve their issues. Give them time to clear their own litter-tray.
* Give developers freedom/creativity to make an impact – stop putting them 100% on a leash.
* I've mentioned about hack time and hack culture in my other documents.
* Let developers grow, solve immediate business problems. Let them feel they have some kind of influence on their own predicament. 
* Thinking is not valued. Creativity is not valued.
* UNFINISHED
