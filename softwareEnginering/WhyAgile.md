What is Agile
=============

Agile is a mindset of reflection. It is not a verb. You don't _do agile_.


Why Agile
=========

* Mental Health and Wellbeing
    * You can make change
        * Daily grind does not feel futile
    * Regular _Clean Start_
        * Summer holiday effect
        * Move on from failures
        * Not a never-ending mountain

Assignee - single person - pah!

    * [Shape Up](https://www.basecamp.com/shapeup) recommends an asynchronous-first approach built around an opinionated project management tool. Six week cycles (followed by two week cooldowns) replace the two-week sprint. Separate tracks help keep the distinction clear between centralized control (shaping) and decentralized decision making (implementation). Lots more time thinking about how to make the process fit the personalities on the team, rather than training the team fit the process.
