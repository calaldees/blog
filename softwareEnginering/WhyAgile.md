What is Agile
=============

Agile is a mindset of reflection. It is not a verb. You don't _do agile_.


Why Agile
=========

* Mental Health and Wellbeing
    * You can make change
        * Daily grind does not feel futile
    * Regular _Clean Start_
        * Summer holiday effect
        * Move on from failures
        * Not a never-ending mountain

Assignee - single person - pah!
