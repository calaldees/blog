[Verse 1]
D
Well I was born up north of Great Slave, 1898,
      G
and I rode near all my life on a ranch near Devil's Gate.
         D
And I've seen this world about me bend and flip and change.
                  A                        G
Hey it feels like rain -- that's a thundercloud.
     D
Well I've been called a coward, but I've seen two World Wars.
    G
And I lost my son Virgil, a Korean reward.
       D
And my Lucy died last summer. You ask me if I cry,
                    A                 Bm
Hell, I'll show you tears: all over this ground,
        G                  A            D
they're falling from these blue Alberta skies.


[Chorus]
D                   A
We're gonna ride forever,
Bm                           G
You can't keep horsemen in a cage.
                  D                    A
Should the angels call, well it's only then
                     G
We'll pull in the reins.


[Verse 2]
 D
Now they tell me I'm an old man, they tell me I am blind.
     G
They took my driver's license, this house ain't far behind.
        D
I said "Jump back all you big suits, you got something wrong
               A                G
'cause I ain't gone. No I ain't gone."
D
I am still breathing, and I still have my pride.
G
And I have my memories, your life it never dies.
         D
Like the wind that blows in thunder, like the stallion on the fly
         A                     Bm
I got it all, and I'm standing tall
G                A           D
Underneath these blue Alberta skies.


[Chorus]
D                   A
We're gonna ride forever,
Bm                           G
You can't keep horsemen in a cage.
                  D                    A
Should the angels call, well it's only then
                     G
We'll pull in the reins.


[Verse 3]
D
So I say to all you old men: Don't let yourselves get broke.
       G
If you think the world's gone crazy and it's scratching at your throat
   D
it's time to dust off that old saddle and get it on a horse.
             A                           Bm
Kick up your spurs: we're gonna run like stink
            G                 A            D
We're gonna tear across these blue Alberta skies.

 
[Chorus]
D                   A
We're gonna ride forever,
Bm                           G
You can't keep horsemen in a cage.
                  D                    A
Should the angels call, well it's only then
                     G
We'll pull in the reins.
