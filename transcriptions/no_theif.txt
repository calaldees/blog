VERSE 1:
       G#                               C#
For a time I thought there was a thief among us
               G#                 Fm           D#
I thought I’d track him down, but prior to my pursuit
      G#                          C#
The smoke had cleared and to my disbelief
              D#                   Fm  D#   C#  
There was no thief, because it was me that lost you
              D#                   Fm  D#   C#  
There was no thief, because it was me that lost you
 
Fm                G#                      C#
I guess it’s safe to say you’re never coming back
Fm               G#                       C#
And I understand why you wouldn’t want to
D#              Fm         C#           G#    C#
I guess it’s up to me to find a way to get to you


CHORUS: 
                 G#                     D#
And there's just one last thing that I have to say
        A#m
As we reflect on the mess of all this that I've made
       G#                      D#
It was cowardice that made me push you away
      A#m                       C#
I was so afraid cause you were so much better than me


VERSE 2: 
    Fm G#    C#
And I can’t see you
Fm  G#     C#
Getting used to
Fm    G#      C#               D#
Living in the midst of your perfection
    Fm G#     C#
And I'm so lost
    Fm G#   C#
How can you trust
Fm        G#      C#         D#
Somewhere the sun is always shining


CHORUS: 
                 G#                     D#
And there's just one last thing that I have to say
        A#m
As we reflect on the mess of all this that I've made
       G#                      D#
It was cowardice that made me push you away
      A#m                       C#
I was so afraid cause you were so much better than me

OUT: Fm                G#                      C#
I guess it’s safe to say you’re never coming back

Strum: G#..
