                C
We never won an award
                    G
We never got on the news
                           G
We weren't the talk of the town
               C
We never got a review
               C
No photography shoots
                   F
For the cover of a fashion magazine
                    C
And if you take a look in the record books
You won't find me

                      C
Everything that we've done
                 G
Has been roundly ignored
                 G
By the makers of taste
              C
And the style reports
                 C
In a time yet to come
                         F
When they're writing the history
             C                    G
Of the human race, there'll be no trace
              C
Of you and me

G

F      G      C
But we did it anyway
F       G   C
We were unaware
F        G    C
Much too busy having fun
   D                C
To know that no-one cared

'Cause you know, we did have some fun
And we did have some laughs
In fact a lot of them were
The best times I ever had
All the places we went
Everything that we did and we said
It’s amazing to think of all the dancing and drink
And all the people we met

And we did it anyway
Just because we could
If I could have that time again
You know what? I bloody would!

So you can stuff your awards
Forget the fame and the wealth
'Cause you know I wouldn't swap
This life for anything else
Who needs a glowing review?
Don’t bother asking for exclusive interviews
I don’t need to have a lot of medals and cash
When I’ve got friends like you

And we'll still do it anyway
Just because it’s good
We don’t need the approval
Of anyone

We'll still do it anyway
And it will be great
Who cares if no-one ever knows?
We’ll do it anyway
We’ll do it anyway
We’ll do it anyway
