   The world is a dynamic mess, of jiggling things             it's hard to believe

   In the quantum world, the world of particles nothing is certain, it's a world of probabilities

   We need a theory of everything (We need a theory of everything), Which is still just beyond our grasp (still just beyond our grasp)

   We need a theory of everything, perhaps, The ultimate, The ultimate triump of science
