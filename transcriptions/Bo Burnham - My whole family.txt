Intro

Gm1                       D
Every time I              go to dinner
Gm1                       D
Seems like I'm getting a  little bit thinner.
Gm1                       D
I'll sit down at the      breakfast table.
Gm1                       D
I can talk, well          they're not able.
Gm1                       D
When I look at            them I find.
Gm1                       D
There's a single question on their mind.
Gm1                            D
I wish it could go back to the way it was
Gm1           D
It's not easy now because...

    My whole family thinks I'm gay   , I guess it's always been that way.
               Cinv2                    Gminv1             D               
    Maybe it's 'cause of the way that I walk    Makes them think I like... boys.

Em(down B,G,E)*2    Cinv2*4   Gminv1(down B,G,D)*2   D*4

The
Gm1                        D          
goddamn question just      won't go away.
Gm1                        D
And I get asked            every single day.
Gm1                        D
But the way they ask it is not a disguise,

Like, "How was your day? Do you like to kiss guys?"
Gm1                        D
This is the worst, Baby    this was my fear.
Gm1                        D
Now their opinions are     crystal clear.

Em            Cinv2         Gminv1               D                       Em
     My whole family now is shocked,  I'm in the closet, and the door is locked.
              Cinv2          Gminv1                D
       Now my glory days are gone,      I was John Elway, now I'm Elton John.

Em            Cinv2      Gminv1               D                  Em       
     My whole family now suspects    watching Spongebob had side-effects.
              Cinv2                 Gminv1         D                       Em
      I'm not gay and that's what I said,   If I'm gay hey, God, strike me dead 

(cough, cough, cough). 
That's weird.

Gm1                    D

Gm1                    D
When I go outside,     what do I see?
Gm1                              D
That the clouds in the sky spell F-A-G.

D D'

Because...

I think that God might think I'm gay.
What does He know anyway?
My grandma gave me a present just last year,
And the card said, "Happy Birthday, Queer!"

My whole family thinks I'm fab.
There's a guy's butt hey, Bo, take a stab.
Why doesn't he get women? There's no other way.
It's 'cause I'm lanky, not 'cause I'm gay, alright?

Not 'cause I'm gay.

Just 'cause I'm afraid of the snow.
Or my favorite color is the rain(Bo)w... that was a joke.
I don't mean to yell, but I fear I must.
'Cause I'm losing the people that I thought I could trust.
Because...

Even my boyfriend thinks I'm gay... Mother fucker!

You all probably think I'm gay...
Man this song is counter-productive.
La la la la la la...

Because...
My whole family thinks I'm gay.
What do they know anyway?
You gotta look right through the haze.
Easy-Bake Oven was just a phase.

My whole family thinks I'm queer.
That is all I ever hear.
But I've been as straight as a ramp,
If you don't count Bible camp.

Bible camp.

I'm not gay I swear.
