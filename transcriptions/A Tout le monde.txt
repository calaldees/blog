Don't remember where I was
I realized life was a game
The more seriously I took things
The harder the rules became
I had no idea what it cost
My life passed before my eyes
I found out how little I accomplished
All my plans denied

F                  G#
So as you read this know my friends
A#                         F
I'd love to stay with you all
F                    G#
Please smile when you think of me
A#                   C#
My bodys gone thats all

 Chorus
F
A tout le monde
D#
A tout les amis
A#
Je vous aime
F
Je dois partir
G#
These are the last words
C
I'll ever speak
A#                  C#
And they'll set me free


F          D#
If my heart was still alive
A#                            F# G#
I know it would surely break
F              D#
And my memories left with you
A#                           F# G#
There's nothing more to say

F        G#
Moving on is a simple thing
A#                        F
What it leaves behind is hard
F                    G#
You know the sleeping feel no more pain
        A#          C#
And the living are scarred

 (Chorus)

My bodys gone thats all
