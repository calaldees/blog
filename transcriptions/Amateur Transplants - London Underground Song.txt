   Some people might like to get a train to work, Or drive in in a Beamer or a Merc.

   The greedy bastards want extra pay for sitting on their arse all day,


   Einv2                 F#inv2
   Even though they earn 30k,

   B                           D#m1
   So I'm standing here in the pouring rain.

   Eint2               F#inv2
   Where the fuck's my fucking train?


          B                   D#m1
   London Underground, London Underground!
               E2            F#2
   They're all lazzy fucking useless cunts!
          B                   D#m1
   London Underground, London Underground!
               E2
   They're all greedy cunts;
             F#2
   I want to shoot them all with a rifle!

All they say is 'please mind the doors!'
And they learn that on their two day course,
This job can be done by a four year old,
They just leave us freezing in the cold.

What you smell is what you get.
Burger King and piss and sweat,
You roast to death in the boiling heat,
With tourists treading on your feet,
And chewing gum on every seat!

So don't tell me to mind the gap!
I want my fucking money back!

London Underground, London Underground!
They're all lazzy fucking useless cunts!
London Underground, London Undeground!
They're all grredy cunts;
I want to shoot them all with a rifle!

B: C#          B         C#       B
T: C#m         B         C#m      B
               lalalala,          lalalala

B:     C#                     B               C#                   B
   The floors are sticky, the seats are damp, every platform has a fucking tramp!

But the drivers get the day off when,
We're all late for work again!

B:        C#                  F
T:        C#                  Fm1
   London Underground, London Underground!
B:       F#                   G#
T:       F#1                  G#1
   wa wa wankers, they're all wankers!

B: 
   London Underground!

Take your Oyster card,
And shove it up your arsehole!
