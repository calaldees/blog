Artist: Bonnie Tyler
Song: Total Eclipse Of The Heart

A#m                          G#
Every now and then I get a little bit lonely, and you're never coming round
A#m                          G#
Every now and then I get a little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears
C#                           F#
Every now and then I get a little bit nervous that the best of all the years have gone by
C#                           F#
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes
E                         A
(Turn around, bright eyes) Every now and the I fall apart
E          		    A
(Turn around, bright eyes) Every now and the I fall apart

A#m                          G#
Every now and then I get a little bit restless and I dream of something wild
A#m                          G#
Every now and then I get a little bit helpless and I'm lying like a child in your arms
C#                           F#
Every now and then I get a little bit angry and I know I've got to get out and cry
C#                           F#
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified but then I see the look in your eyes
E                         A
(Turn around, bright eyes) Every now and the I fall apart
E          		    A				G#
(Turn around, bright eyes) Every now and the I fall apart

       Fm              C#            D#                 G#

           Fm            C#              D#            G#

And we'll only be making it right 'cause we'll never be wrong
