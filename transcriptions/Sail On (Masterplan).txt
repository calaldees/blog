Can you see it in your mind

B: E   B C D


Wearing the mask for so long
The clown must believe to hold on
Throw down your fears and guide the strength which lies within

We always have to sail on
Out of shadows to the light beyond
Never shut your weary eyes
But always try to see the line
Can you see it in your mind

Can you see it in your mind

Never shut your weary eyes
But always try to see the line
Can you see it in your mind

Can you see it in your mind

Can you see the line
See the line through the wheel
Can you see the line
