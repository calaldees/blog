Ab [Eb,Ab,C]               Eb [Eb,G,Bb]
Nothing I say comes out right,
                      BbM [F,Bb,Db]
I cant love without a fight,
                     Db [F,Ab,Db]
No one ever knows my name,
                        Ab
When I pray for sun, it rains.
                       Eb
I'm so sick of wasting time,
                          BbM
But nothings moving in my mind,
                    Db
Inspiration cant be found,

I will fight, and Ill sleep when I die,
Db        Eb       Ab
I'll live my life, I'm Alive!

Every lover breaks my heart,
And I know it from the start,
Still I end up in a mess,
Every time I second guess.
All my friends just run away,
When I'm having a bad day,
I would rather stay in bed, but I know there's a reason.

I'm Alive, I'm Alive, oh yeah
Between the good and bad is where you'll find me,
Reaching for heaven.
I will fight, and Ill sleep when I die,
I'll live my life, I'm Alive!

When I'm bored to death at home,
When he wont pick up the phone,
When I'm stuck in second place,
Those regrets I cant erase.
Only I can change the end,
Of the movie in my head,
There's no time for misery,
I wont feel sorry for me.

I'm Alive, I'm Alive, oh yeah
Between the good and bad is where you�ll find me,
Reaching for heaven.
I will fight, and Ill sleep when I die,
Ill live my life, ohhh!

I'm Alive, I'm Alive, oh yeah
Between the good and bad is where you�ll find me,
Reaching for heaven.
I will fight, and Ill sleep when I die,
Ill live my life,
Ill live my life,
I'm ALIVE!!!!!!!
