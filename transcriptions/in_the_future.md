=============

There is far to much chiptune madness going on here.
I just made up my own chords loosly inspried by the lyrics

D#                              G#inv1    A#
When I watched kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey,
One scene in particular made a lasting impression on me.
    Cm                                   Gm             A#
The astronauts were having breakfast and catching up on TV,
C#                            G#             A#
on a portable touch activated handheld video screen.
D#                                     G#             A#
I know it's just a daydream but I cant wait until the time,
            D#                 G#           A#
when such a wondrous gadget is available to buy.
      Cm               G#                     A#
We're get from kind of futuristic high street store
       C#                                          A#inv2
with a staircase made of glass and an apple shaped logo on the door.

D#inv1
I want to live in the future, cos the future is where miracles come true.
Cm
I cant wait for it come now, and I somehow know it's gonna happen soon.
G#                             G#m
We'll all be too exited by are awesome futuristic lives, 
   G#              B
to notice that the future has arrived.


We'll use star trek communicators as a way to interact.
With access to all unearthly knowledge and funny pictures of cats.
We'll go around in capsules that travel in tubes beneath the sea,
That leave London at lunchtime and reach Paris in time for tea.

Our food will come in pellet for like pils but slightly thinner,
designed to recreate the flavour of a full roast dinner.
Dispensed from robot arms and served in tiny silver packs,
containing just the right amount of delicious potato snacks.

because the future has arrived
